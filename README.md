# InterviewCode
This was a coding challenge that was used for an interview. There is two parts of this project. First in the 90 minutes coding timed trial. The code that I completed in those 90 minutes can be found under "90Min" in this repo. To run the code type:

node quesitonOne.js

The second part was where I was given the opportunity to complete all the question. This code can be found under "Complete" in this repo. This has two runnable scripts and they can be run using the following commands:

node quesitonOne.js
node quesitonTwo.js

The instruction for this challenge can be found at the base of this repo and called instructions.txt.
